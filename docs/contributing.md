Hi, if you're here it means that you want to contribute to this awesome project, and help people anywhere in the world 
getting started with the subject or tool you love! That is great!

## Easiest way to contribute
The easiest way to contribute would be by sharing this repository with everyone you know. Send it to everyone who might enjoy leaning something new!
 
## Contributing with new guides
If you want to write a new guide, that would be great! You can contact us if you want to be sure that no one else is already writing about what you had in mind, or to find out if someone else would be interested in helping you write about a particular topic!

If you want to write a guide, please take some time to read a couple of them to get a feel for the style that the guides should follow. You can have a look at the WolframAlpha or GeoGebra guides.

Before writing, you also need check the [**template.md**](template.md) file that accompanies this README.

Do your best to write clearly and without errors! Provide relevant links whenever you can and only free resources. You are welcome to leave your contact details in the end of the guide, but you are not forced to do so!

## Creating a Pull Request
If you are going to create a Pull Request, regardless of the reason, please take the time to give the PR a concise, relevant title (less than 50 characters) and write a descriptive, informative summary in the larger text field. This will let us review your PR faster, instead of having to first interpret what you did, and then decide if the changes are any good (which they probably are!).

We are very interested in having people help us! That is the point of a community! But we would rather not spend hours trying to decipher the changes you made.
